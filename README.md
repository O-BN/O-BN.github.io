I'm a PhD student from Jakub (Kobi) [Abramson's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/dept/irb/abramson/).

  In my research, I'm trying to characterize unit cells in the immune system called extra thymic Aire expressing cells (eTACs).

My PhD focuses on three aspects of these cells:

1.	Molecular and cellular characterization of RORγt+ eTACs 
Project Goal: eTAC detailed molecular, cellular, and spatial characterization remains incomplete. Our hypothesis, based on preliminary results and published data, indicates that RORγt+ eTACs consist of several molecularly and likely functionally distinct subsets. To this end, we will apply advanced technologies and single-cell "omics" approaches to achieve a thorough molecular, cellular, and spatial analysis.

2.	Developmental characterization of RORγt+ eTAC
Project Goal: The lineage identity of RORγt+ eTACs remains elusive and controversial. We hypothesize that they represent a separate branch of the innate lymphoid lineage. To address this question, we aim to identify the BM progenitors of these cells. Additionally, we plan to characterize their maturation within the pLN.

3.	Molecular characterization of extrathymic Aire
Project Goal: We aim to further understand the molecular and structural differences between thymic and extrathymic Aire at the RNA and protein levels. This knowledge will help further elucidate its role in the peripheral immune system.

  In my spare time, when I'm not in the lab, I prefer to spend time in the garden taking care of plants.
