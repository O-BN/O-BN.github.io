Welcome to my page as part of the Weizmann basic programming skills (Python) 2024.11 taught by [Gábor Szabó](https://szabgab.com/)

I'm a PhD student from Jakub (Kobi) [Abramson's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/dept/irb/abramson/).
  In my research, I'm trying to characterize unit cells in the immune system.

  In my spare time, when I'm not in the lab, I prefer to spend time in the garden taking care of plants.
